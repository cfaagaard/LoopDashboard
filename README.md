# LoopDashboard

This repository is used for a dashboard that shows the commits in the different "Loop" repositories.

The dashboard can be seen here: [http:/loopdashboard.azurewebsites.net](http:/loopdashboard.azurewebsites.net)

The dashboard shows commits from the repositories defined in the [content.xml](https://github.com/cfaagaard/LoopDashboard/blob/master/Content.xml). You are welcome to make a pull request if you think I have missed a repository or a branch.

If you wish to provide feedback, please create an issue. 


Thank you.
